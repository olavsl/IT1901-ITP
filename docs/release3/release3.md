**The work process**
 * At group meeting for Sprint 3 we discussed what we had done so far, and what we needed to do before the deadline.
 * We had a Sprint Planning Meeting, where we distributed the remaining user stories among us, and decided to add the REST-API to the project. 
 * We made a document with the remaining tasks for the project, and distributed them among us.
 * During the span of one weeks, each worked on their user story(ies), both together and individually.
