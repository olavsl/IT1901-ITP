# Release 2

**Implemented functionality for release 2**
 * More tests for everything
 * Saving to a JSON file instead of txt, as changes occur (no action needed to save data)
 * Log in actually checking credentials
 * Updated design of the UI
 * Improved user feedback and error handling

**Implemented documentation for release 2**
 * User stories in [user_stories.md](../user_stories.md)
 * Decisions made in [decisions.md](../decisions.md)
 * A package [diagram](../Diagrams/packagediagram.png) made with plantuml

**Other**
 * Modulerized the project, now consits of a parent project with the modules core and ui separated
 * Standerdised workflow, see [decisions.md](../decisions.md)
 * Implemented Jacoco and Spotbugs for better code management in the future

**The Work Process**
 * At our second group meeting we discussed what we had done so far, and what we needed to do before the deadline.
 * We had a Sprint Planning Meeting, where we distributed the remaining user stories among us.
 * During the span of one week, each worked on their user story(ies).
 * After one week we had our second weekly meeting, where everyone presented their work so far and discussed challenges that had come up.
 * We learnt that we needed a little more time to finish the sprint before it was ready for Release 2, so we decided to extend the deadline to 16.10.2022.
