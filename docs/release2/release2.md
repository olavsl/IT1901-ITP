**The Work Process**
 * At our second group meeting we discussed what we had done so far, and what we needed to do before the deadline.
 * We had a Sprint Planning Meeting, where we distributed the remaining user stories among us.
 * During the span of one week, each worked on their user story(ies).
 * After one week we had our second weekly meeting, where everyone presented their work so far and discussed challenges that had come up.
 * We learnt that we needed a little more time to finish the sprint before it was ready for Release 2, so we decided to extend the deadline to 16.10.2022.
